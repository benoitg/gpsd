issues identified:

* vyn / nmea2000.c:

[x] fast packages could be interrupted by other fast transmissions or single packages
[x] there is no error tracking for that even
[ ] see to avoid double pgn in stm32 - sort also for faster bisect search
[ ] can't see any delays - but obviously errors
[ ] all instruments and sentence types found on screen


* AIS

[ ] 2 part AIS messages will likely never be put together
[ ] should set MMSI to get own position for N2K,
  this requires having access to vessel data when parsing N2K ais header
[ ] tables with ships on screen

[x] type24_queue->index seems to never be set to 0 (it does)
[ ] storing name data is a bit weird in anyways in 129809, context and AIVDM channels
(these last 2 solved - gpsd_init does it by setting whole sturct to 0)


* test

[ ] stats on home screen
[ ] test link on home screen
[ ] input state on screen
[ ] stats and config into test-out

* ease of use

[ ] help to detect and mount and use
[ ] setup button for Navionics UDP

* STM32

[x] in queue it looks like push can actually push beyond tail (probably corrupting quite a few messages)
[ ] currently a seatalk sentence will be only sent on next command, more stable but delays can occur 

* general

[ ] vyspi_dump does cut last number in array
[ ] fragment rounds
[ ] devices when being read require some better round robin
[ ] when many fragments are being parsed then older ones that are obsolete should be skipped
[ ] fix EC-re-writer
[ ] fix list with N2K sentences
[ ] want to make sure that data coming via TCP is parsed for correctness
[ ] rather copy inbuffer to outbuffer during frame parsing
