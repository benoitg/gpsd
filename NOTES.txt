issues identified:

* vyn / nmea2000.c:

- fast packages could be interrupted by other fast transmissions or single packages
- there is no error tracking for that even
- see to avoid double pgn in stm32 - sort also for faster bisect search
- can't see any delays - but obviously errors
- all instruments and sentence types found on screen


* AIS

- 2 part AIS messages will likely never be put together
- should set MMSI to get own position for N2K,
  this requires having access to vessel data when parsing N2K ais header
- tables with ships on screen

- type24_queue->index seems to never be set to 0
- storing name data is a bit weird in anyways in 129809, context and AIVDM channels
(these last 2 solved - gpsd_init does it by setting whole sturct to 0)


* test

- stats on home screen
- test link on home screen
- input state on screen
- stats and config into test-out

* ease of use

- help to detect and mount and use
- setup button for Navionics UDP

* STM32

- in queue it looks like push can actually push beyond tail (probably corrupting quite a few messages)
